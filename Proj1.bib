  abstract = {CONTEXT: Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem. Screening for early identification could improve health but could also lead to unnecessary harms and excess costs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of periodic, population-based dipstick screening for early detection of urine protein in adults with neither hypertension nor diabetes and in adults with hypertension. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov decision analytic model to compare a strategy of annual screening with no screening (usual care) for proteinuria at age 50 years followed by treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor blocker (ARB). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: For persons with neither hypertension nor diabetes, the cost-effectiveness ratio for screening vs no screening (usual care) was unfavorable (282 818 dollars per QALY; incremental cost of 616 dollars and a gain of 0.0022 QALYs per person). However, screening such persons beginning at age 60 years yielded a more favorable ratio (53 372 dollars per QALY). For persons with hypertension, the ratio was highly favorable (18 621 dollars per QALY; incremental cost of 476 dollars and a gain of 0.03 QALYs per person). Cost-effectiveness was mediated by both chronic kidney disease progression and death prevention benefits of ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy. Influential parameters that might make screening for the general population more cost-effective include a greater incidence of proteinuria, age at screening (53 372 dollars per QALY for persons beginning screening at age 60 years), or lower frequency of screening (every 10 years: 80 700 dollars per QALY at age 50 years; 6195 dollars per QALY at age 60 years; and 5486 dollars per QALY at age 70 years). CONCLUSIONS: Early detection of urine protein to slow progression of chronic kidney disease and decrease mortality is not cost-effective unless selectively directed toward high-risk groups (older persons and persons with hypertension) or conducted at an infrequent interval of 10 years.},

The 3H-T L.I. of "round" cells infiltrating the dermis was much higher in lesions of psoriatic erythroderma (4.03 +/- 0.56\%) than in lesions of psoriasis vulgaris (0.62 +/- 0.21\%), and the difference is highly significant (p less than 0.0001). The findings indicate that most of these labelled cells could well be lymphoblasts, suggesting that an immunological process is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of psoriatic erythroderma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity and chronic pain are common comorbidities and adversely influence each other. Advanced age is associated with more comorbidities and multi-morbidities. In this study, we investigated the burden of overweight/obesity and its comorbidities and their associations with chronic pain in a random population sample of Swedish older adults. METHODS: The cross-sectional analysis involved a random sample of a population\,≥\,65~years in south-eastern Sweden (N\,=\,6243). Data were collected from a postal questionnaire that addressed pain aspects, body mass index (BMI), and health experiences. Chronic pain was defined as pain during the previous three months. According to the 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale, pain scored ≥7 corresponds to severe pain. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the variables associated to pain aspects. RESULTS: A total of 2633 (42\%) reported chronic pain. More obese older adults (BMI ≥30~kg/m2) experienced chronic pain (58\%) than those who were low-normal weight (BMI {$<$}\,25~kg/m2, 39\%) or overweight (25\,≤\,BMI {$<$}\,30~kg/m2, 41\%). Obese elderly more frequently had pain in extremities and lower back than their peers. In the multivariate model, obesity (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.59, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.33-1.91) but not overweight (OR 1.08, 95\% CI 0.95-1.22) was associated with chronic pain. Obesity (OR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.16-2.01) was also significantly related to severe pain. We also found other comorbidities - i.e., traumatic history (OR 2.52, 95\% CI 1.99-3.19), rheumatic diseases (OR 5.21, 95\% CI 4.54-5.97), age\,≥\,85~years (OR 1.66, 95\% CI 1.22-2.25), and depression or anxiety diagnosis (OR 1.83, 95\% CI 1.32-2.53) - showed stronger associations with pain aspects than weight status. CONCLUSION: In older adults, excess weight (BMI 30 or above) is a potentially modifiable factor but not the only risk factor that is associated with chronic pain and severe pain. Future studies should investigate the effectiveness of interventions that treat comorbid pain and obesity in older adults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most falls occur during walking and are due to trips, slips or misplaced steps, which suggests a reduced walking adaptability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential merit of a walking-adaptability assessment for identifying prospective fallers and risk factors for future falls in a cohort of stroke patients, Parkinson's disease patients, and controls (n\,=\,30 for each group). RESEARCH QUESTION: Does an assessment of walking-adaptability improve the identification of fallers compared to generic fall-risk factors alone? METHODS: This study comprised an evaluation of subject characteristics, clinical gait and balance tests, a quantitative gait assessment and a walking-adaptability assessment with the Interactive Walkway. Subjects' falls were registered prospectively with falls calendars during a 6-month follow-up period. Generic and walking-related fall-risk factors were compared between prospective fallers and non-fallers. Binary logistic regression and Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector analyses were performed to identify fallers and predictor variables for future falls. RESULTS: In addition to fall history, obstacle-avoidance success rate and normalized walking speed during goal-directed stepping correctly classified prospective fallers and were predictors of future falls. Compared to the use of generic fall-risk factors only, the inclusion of walking-related fall-risk factors improved the identification of prospective fallers. SIGNIFICANCE: If cross-validated in future studies with larger samples, these fall-risk factors may serve as quick entry tests for falls prevention programs. In addition, the identification of these walking-related fall-risk factors may help in developing falls prevention strategies.},

Morphine treatment induced an 8-fold increase in plasma IR-ANF (P less than 0.001) from 68.1 +/- 9.3 (mean +/- S.E.) to 540.5 +/- 139.5 pg/ml and this increase was completely abolished by pretreatment with the opioid antagonist naloxone (P less than 0.001) to 37.9 +/- 2.8 pg/ml. Naloxone also significantly decreased the basal IR-ANF level (P less than 0.05) to 49.0 +/- 5.3 pg/ml. When naloxone-pretreated and control rats were infused with saline (8 ml) the IR-ANF response was the same in the two groups: 257.7 +/- 64 and 247 +/- 52 pg/ml respectively. Since ANF is a potent natriuretic and diuretic hormone, the morphine-induced increase of plasma IR-ANF may provide a rational basis for explaining the diuretic effect of morphine in conscious non-hydrated rats. Moreover, the decrease of basal plasma IR-ANF suggests the possible implication of endogenous opioids in the regulation of basal ANF secretion.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In utero tobacco exposure has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes but few studies have used longitudinal ultrasound measurements to asses the effects on fetal growth. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of active and passive smoking during pregnancy on fetal biometry in a cohort of Spanish women. METHODS: Biparietal diameter (BPD), abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL) and estimated fetal weight (EFW) were evaluated in each trimester of pregnancy. Detailed information on smoking and potential confounders was assessed by questionnaire. SD scores were calculated from longitudinal growth curves adjusted for gestational age and potential determinants of growth. Size was assessed by means of unconditional SD scores at 12, 20, 32 and 38 weeks of pregnancy, while growth between these points was assessed by means of conditional SD scores. The association between smoking and fetal growth was investigated by regression models and adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle-related variables. RESULTS: Maternal smoking was inversely associated with size of all parameters at weeks 32 and 38 and with growth in 20-32, 12-32 and 12-38 week intervals. In 32-38 weeks the effect was significant for AC and EFW. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure was inversely associated with growth in BPD in all the intervals except 32-38 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Active smoking during pregnancy was associated with a reduction in BPD, AC, FL and EFW from mid-gestation. ETS adversely affected BPD from early pregnancy.},

Data on main-stream tobacco smoke (MS) and side-stream tobacco smoke (SS) and the birth weight of children were collected by standardized interviews with mothers. As expected, exposure to MS tobacco smoke was the single strongest factor related to the reduced birth weight, however, the effect was statistically significant only in those respondents who confirmed the cigarette smoking over the whole pregnancy period. On the basis of multiple regression model considering child's gender, active and passive smoking during pregnancy, parity and gestational age, it was estimated that MS tobacco smoke is to reduce the birth weight on average by about 210 g, however, in heavy smokers up to 450 g. The effect of SS tobacco smoke was to reduce birth weight by about 60 g after accounting for confounders. Both effects of active and passive smoking in pregnancy were statistically significant. When the self-reported smoking status was compared with plasma cotinine levels in women at delivery, a substantial misclassification error has been disclosed and it resulted mainly from the low sensitivity (47\%) of the self-reported data on smoking status. This exposure bias may lead to a significant underestimation of correlation between low birth weight ({$<$} 2500 g) and tobacco smoking of mothers in pregnancy. Odds ratio (OR) corrected to exposure misclassification was much higher than the crude one (corrected OR = 8.0, crude OR = 2.9).},

  abstract = {Older women with low bone density have an increased risk of fracture, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. However, it is not known whether this association is caused by ongoing bone loss or by lower bone mass earlier in life. To determine whether rate of bone loss is associated with total and cause-specific mortality, we prospectively studied 6046 women aged 65 years or older who had serial bone mineral density (BMD) measurements as a part of the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Rates (mean +/- SD) of loss of BMD at the heel (for a mean of 5.7 years) and hip (for a mean of 3.5 years) were estimated. Cause-specific mortality was ascertained from death certificates and hospital records. BMD loss at the heel was 5.9 +/- 6.0 mg/cm2 per year (1.5 +/- 1.5\%) and BMD loss at the hip was 4.1 +/- 10.2 mg/cm2 per year (0.6 +/- 1.4\%). During an average follow-up of 3.2 years after the second measurement of BMD, 371 deaths occurred. Each SD increase in BMD loss at the hip was associated with a 1.3-fold (95\% CI, 1.1-1.4) increase in total mortality, adjusted for age, baseline BMD, diabetes, hypertension, incident fractures, smoking, physical activity, health status, weight loss, and calcium use. In particular, hip BMD loss was associated with increased mortality from coronary heart disease (relative hazard [RH] = 1.3 per SD; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.8) and pulmonary diseases (RH = 1.6 per SD; 95\% CI, 1.1-2.5). The findings were similar for bone loss at the heel, except there was no significant association with pulmonary mortality. These results raise the possibility that bone loss may share common etiologies with coronary and pulmonary diseases.},

  abstract = {CKD mineral and bone disease is a common complication of kidney disease, and it affects the majority of patients with moderate to severe CKD. Recently, prospective studies have shown that measurement of bone mineral density by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry predicts incident fracture, providing nephrologists the ability to risk classify patients for skeletal fragility and targeted antifracture strategies for the first time. Furthermore, an expanding body of literature and anecdotal evidence suggest that pharmacologic agents used to treat osteoporosis in the general population can be safely used in patients with CKD. This review highlights the effects of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes updates on the management of CKD-associated osteoporosis, discusses recent investigations on the effects of antiosteoporotic agents in patients with CKD, and provides an overview of novel antiosteoporosis agents and the potential challenges related to their use in CKD.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of death, is mostly precipitated by cardiometabolic risk and chronic kidney disease (CKD). CVD and kidney disease are closely interrelated and disease of one organ cause dysfunction of the other, ultimately leading to the failure of both organs. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at much higher risk of mortality due to CVD. Traditional CVD risk factors viz., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes do not account for the high cardiovascular risk in CKD patients and also standard clinical interventions for managing CVD that are successful in the general population, are ineffective to lower the death rate in CKD patients. Nontraditional factors, related to disturbed mineral and vitamin D metabolism were able to provide some explanation in terms of vascular calcification, for the increased risk of CVD in CKD. Fibroblast Growth Factor 23, a bone-derived hormone that regulates vitamin D synthesis in renal proximal tubules and renal phosphate reabsorption, has been suggested to be the missing link between CKD and CVD. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is strongly related to the progress of CVD and its early diagnosis and treatment has significant positive effect on the outcomes of CVD in the affected patients. Besides this, non-dialysable protein-bound uraemic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, produced by colonic microbes from dietary amino acids, appear to cause renal dysfunction. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting colonic microbiota, have led to new prospects in early intervention for CKD patients. Intervention targets for preventing CVD events in CKD patients ideally should include control of blood pressure and dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, lowering proteinuria, correction of anemia, management of mineral metabolism abnormalities and life style changes including smoking cessation, decreased consumption of salt, and achievement of normal body mass index. Use of β-blockers, renin-angiotensin blockers, diuretics, statins, and aspirin are helpful in the early stages of CKD. In this review, we will address the biological, pathological and clinical relationship between CVD and CKD and their therapeutic management.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Falls and their consequences are significant concerns for older adults, caregivers, and health care providers. Identification of fall risk is crucial for appropriate referral to preventive interventions. Falls are multifactorial; no single measure is an accurate diagnostic tool. There is limited information on which history question, self-report measure, or performance-based measure, or combination of measures, best predicts future falls. PURPOSE: First, to evaluate the predictive ability of history questions, self-report measures, and performance-based measures for assessing fall risk of community-dwelling older adults by calculating and comparing posttest probability (PoTP) values for individual test/measures. Second, to evaluate usefulness of cumulative PoTP for measures in combination. DATA SOURCES: To be included, a study must have used fall status as an outcome or classification variable, have a sample size of at least 30 ambulatory community-living older adults (≥65 years), and track falls occurrence for a minimum of 6 months. Studies in acute or long-term care settings, as well as those including participants with significant cognitive or neuromuscular conditions related to increased fall risk, were excluded. Searches of Medline/PubMED and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) from January 1990 through September 2013 identified 2294 abstracts concerned with fall risk assessment in community-dwelling older adults. STUDY SELECTION: Because the number of prospective studies of fall risk assessment was limited, retrospective studies that classified participants (faller/nonfallers) were also included. Ninety-five full-text articles met inclusion criteria; 59 contained necessary data for calculation of PoTP. The Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) was used to assess each study's methodological quality. DATA EXTRACTION: Study design and QUADAS score determined the level of evidence. Data for calculation of sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), likelihood ratios (LR), and PoTP values were available for 21 of 46 measures used as search terms. An additional 73 history questions, self-report measures, and performance-based measures were used in included articles; PoTP values could be calculated for 35. DATA SYNTHESIS: Evidence tables including PoTP values were constructed for 15 history questions, 15 self-report measures, and 26 performance-based measures. Recommendations for clinical practice were based on consensus. LIMITATIONS: Variations in study quality, procedures, and statistical analyses challenged data extraction, interpretation, and synthesis. There was insufficient data for calculation of PoTP values for 63 of 119 tests. CONCLUSIONS: No single test/measure demonstrated strong PoTP values. Five history questions, 2 self-report measures, and 5 performance-based measures may have clinical usefulness in assessing risk of falling on the basis of cumulative PoTP. Berg Balance Scale score (≤50 points), Timed Up and Go times (≥12 seconds), and 5 times sit-to-stand times (≥12) seconds are currently the most evidence-supported functional measures to determine individual risk of future falls. Shortfalls identified during review will direct researchers to address knowledge gaps.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if self-reported data recalling at least one fall over a six-month recall period could be used as a reliable measure of falls by comparing retrospective self-report with a 'gold standard' method of reporting these events using a prospective calendar-reported method. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Community-dwelling older people living in New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland in Australia. SUBJECTS: A stratified sample of 264 randomly selected participants from a concurrent randomized controlled trial (RCT) of preventive health assessment for people over the age of 70 years. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention and control group participants in the RCT kept a calendar of fall events for a six-month validation substudy. At the end of six months, participants were asked to retrospectively report their falls over the six-month period. MAIN RESULTS: Results indicated that percentage agreement between retrospective self-report and the calendar report of falls was 84\%, however, sensitivity was 56\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 44.1-67.5). Ten participants (4\%) gave false positive self-reports of falls, and 33 (13\%) participants gave false negative self-reports of falls. Therefore, retrospective self-reported fall rates were likely to involve under-reporting of falls. Significant differences were found in the sensitivity of retrospectively self-reported falls reported by the intervention group participants (sensitivity = 71\%; 95\% CI 56.6-85.5) compared with the control group (sensitivity = 40.5\%; 95\% CI 24.7-56.4, P = 0.008). Validity of self-reported injuries as a result of a fall was less accurate (71\% agreement; sensitivity 24\% (95\% CI 16.0-33.6). CONCLUSIONS: As recall of falls was more accurate in the intervention group than in the control group, it could appear that the intervention had the effect of increasing falls compared to the control group. Using these results, a method was devised to weight self-reported retrospective data to compensate for the poorer recall demonstrated in the control group, so that a more accurate estimate of falls could be derived from the self-reported data.},

In 1970, Jewett, Romano and Williston presented the first full description of the scalp responses, postulated to be generated by brainstem nuclei. Since then, the auditory brainstem response (ABR) technique has attracted attention because it satisfied two previously unattainable needs; 1) a means of quantitative measurement of changes in auditory function in newborn babies or uncooperative patients, and 2) the detection of brainstem neurological abnormalities. Recording during wakefulness and in sleep or under drug intoxication has shown that ABRs are independent of the level of arousal or attention, and this feature is particularly useful for people unable to cooperate appropriately. Because of the close relationship to the anatomy of brainstem pathways, ABRs offer a neurophysiological index of neuronal function at the level of the brainstem. At present, these responses have become widely recognized as an important tool for the diagnosis of neurological diseases. One specific feature of the ABR is its dependence on maturation. The ABR appears at around 26 weeks of gestation and thereafter undergoes systematic changes in latency, amplitude and threshold. By using a supramaximal intensity of more than 60 dBHL, it is possible to evoke in all newborn babies with sufficient hearing ability, waves I, III and V.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Here we use a digital humanities and data science approach to examine how lyrics changed between the 1950’s and the more recent years, and apply quantitative analysis to measure these changes. To identify possible differences, we analyzed the sentiments expressed in the songs of the Billboard Hot 100, which reflects the preferences of popular music listeners and fans in each year. Automatic sentiment analysis of 6,150 Billboard 100 songs covering all the years from 1951 through 2016 shows clear and statistically significant changes in sentiments expressed through the lyrics of popular music, generally towards a more negative tone. The results show that anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and conscientiousness have increased significantly, while joy, confidence, and openness expressed in pop song lyrics have declined.},

The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study is a prospective cohort study designed to examine the extent to which fracture risk is related to bone mass, bone geometry, lifestyle, anthropometric and neuromuscular measures, and fall propensity, as well as to determine how fractures affect quality of life in men. The study is also designed to understand how osteoporosis is related to prostate disease. At baseline, participants completed questionnaires regarding medical history, medications, physical activity, diet, alcohol intake, and cigarette smoking. Objective measures of anthropometric, neuromuscular, vision, strength, and cognitive variables were obtained. Skeletal assessments included DEXA, calcaneal ultrasound, and vertebral radiographs. Vertebral and proximal femoral QCT was performed on a subset (65\%). Serum, urine, and DNA specimens were collected. After the baseline assessments, a questionnaire is mailed to participants every 4 months to ascertain incident falls, fractures, prostate cancer, and deaths. After an average of 4.5 years, participants are scheduled to return for a second comprehensive visit. Men were eligible if {$>$} or =65 years. 5995 men enrolled with a mean (+/-SD) age of 73.7 (+/-5.9) years, 11\% of which were minorities. Most rated their health as good/excellent. Few were current smokers, although 59\% had smoked previously, and 35\% reported no alcohol intake, while 47\% consumed at least 2 drinks per week. The mean (range) body mass index was 26.9 kg/m2 (17-56). A non-traumatic fracture after age 50 was reported by 17\% of the cohort. The MrOS cohort should provide valuable information concerning the determinants of fracture in men and should help set the stage for the development of effective methods to identify those at risk.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Smoking during pregnancy may negatively impact newborn birth weight. This study investigates the relationship between maternal active smoking during pregnancy and low birth weight in the Americas through systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A literature search was conducted through indexed databases and the grey literature. Case-control and cohort studies published between 1984 and 2016 conducted within the Americas were included without restriction regarding publication language. The article selection process and data extraction were performed by two independent investigators. A meta-analysis of random effects was conducted, and possible causes of between-study heterogeneity were evaluated by meta-regressions and subgroup analyses. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of Begg's funnel plot and by Egger's regression test. Results: The literature search yielded 848 articles from which 34 studies were selected for systematic review and 30 for meta-analysis. Active maternal smoking was associated with low birth weight, OR = 2.00 (95\% CI: 1.77-2.26; I2 = 66.3\%). The funnel plot and Egger's test (p = .14) indicated no publication bias. Meta-regression revealed that sample size, study quality, and the number of confounders in the original studies did not account for the between-study heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences when studies were compared by design, sample size, and regions of the Americas. Conclusion: Low birth weight is associated with maternal active smoking during pregnancy regardless of the region in the Americas or the studies' methodological aspects. Implications: A previous search of the major electronic databases revealed that no studies appear to have been conducted to summarize the association between maternal active smoking during pregnancy and low birth weight within the Americas. Therefore, this systematic review may help to fill the information gap. The region of the Americas contains some of the most populous countries in the world; therefore, this study may provide useful data from this massive segment of the world's population.},

  abstract = {The aging and elderly population are particularly susceptible to cardiovascular disease. Age is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in adults, but these risks are compounded by additional factors, including frailty, obesity, and diabetes. These factors are known to complicate and enhance cardiac risk factors that are associated with the onset of advanced age. Sex is another potential risk factor in aging adults, given that older females are reported to be at a greater risk for CVD than age-matched men. However, in both men and women, the risks associated with CVD increase with age, and these correspond to an overall decline in sex hormones, primarily of estrogen and testosterone. Despite this, hormone replacement therapies are largely shown to not improve outcomes in older patients and may also increase the risks of cardiac events in older adults. This review discusses current findings regarding the impacts of age and gender on heart disease.},

  abstract = {Body mass index (BMI) has various deficiencies as a measure of obesity, especially when the BMI measure is based on self-reported height and weight. BMI is an indirect measure of body fat compared with more direct approaches such as bioelectrical impedance. Moreover, BMI does not necessarily reflect the changes that occur with age. The proportion of body fat increases with age, whereas muscle mass decreases, but corresponding changes in height, weight and BMI may not reflect changes in body fat and muscle mass. Both the sensitivity and specificity of BMI have been shown to be poor. Additionally, the relation between BMI and percentage of body fat is not linear and differs for men and women. The consequences of the errors in the measurement of obesity with BMI depend on whether they are differential or nondifferential. Differential misclassification, a potentially greater problem in case-control and cross-sectional studies than in prospective cohort studies, can produce a bias toward or away from the null. Nondifferential misclassification produces a bias toward the null for a dichotomous exposure; for measures of exposure that are not dichotomous, the bias may be away from the null. In short, the use of BMI as a measure of obesity can introduce misclassification problems that may result in important bias in estimating the effects related to obesity.},

  abstract = {Background Pulmonary hypertension is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and may be associated with poor outcomes. The magnitude of the association between pulmonary hypertension and mortality is uncertain due to the small size and variable findings of observational studies. Study Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies using subgroup analyses and metaregression. Setting \& Population Patients with ESRD or earlier stages of CKD. Selection Criteria for Studies Observational studies reporting clinical outcomes in patients with co-existing pulmonary hypertension and CKD or ESRD identified using a systematic search of PubMed and Embase. Predictor Pulmonary hypertension diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography. Outcomes All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular events. Results 16 studies, with 7,112 patients with an overall pulmonary hypertension prevalence of 23\%, were included. Pulmonary hypertension was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality among patients with CKD (relative risk [RR], 1.44; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.76), with ESRD receiving maintenance dialysis (RR, 2.32; 95\% CI, 1.91-2.83), and with a functioning kidney transplant (RR, 2.08; 95\% CI, 1.35-3.20). Pulmonary hypertension was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events in patients with CKD (RR, 1.67; 95\% CI, 1.07-2.60) and ESRD receiving dialysis (RR, 2.33; 95\% CI, 1.76-3.08). There was an association between pulmonary hypertension and increased risk for cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD or ESRD (RR, 2.20; 95\% CI, 1.53-3.15). Limitations Heterogeneity of included studies, possibility of residual confounding, unavailability of individual patient-level data, and possibility of outcome reporting bias. Conclusions Pulmonary hypertension is associated with a substantially increased risk for death and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD and ESRD. Risk is higher in patients with ESRD receiving dialysis compared with patients with CKD stages 1 to 5. Understanding the effect of interventions to lower pulmonary artery pressure on the survival of these patents awaits their evaluation in randomized controlled trials.},

  abstract = {Background:               The American Heart Association, in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health, annually reports the most up-to-date statistics related to heart disease, stroke, and cardiovascular risk factors, including core health behaviors (smoking, physical activity, diet, and weight) and health factors (cholesterol, blood pressure, and glucose control) that contribute to cardiovascular health. The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs).                                         Methods:               The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2021 Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year’s edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, the global burden of cardiovascular disease, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors related to cardiovascular disease.                                         Results:               Each of the 27 chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics.                                         Conclusions:               The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.},

  abstract = {Background               The relative effects of combinations of CKD, heart disease, and stroke on risk of mortality, direct medical costs, and life expectancy are unknown.                                         Methods                                In a retrospective cohort study of 506,849 Chinese adults in Hong Kong with hypertension, we used Cox regressions to examine associations between all-cause mortality and combinations of moderate CKD (eGFR of 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m                 2                 ), severe CKD (eGFR of 15–29 ml/min per 1.73 m                 2                 ), heart disease (coronary heart disease or heart failure), and stroke, and modeling to estimate annual public direct medical costs and life expectancy.                                                        Results               Over a median follow-up of 5.8 years (2.73 million person-years), 55,666 deaths occurred. Having an increasing number of comorbidities was associated with incremental increases in mortality risk and medical costs and reductions in life expectancy. Compared with patients who had neither CKD nor cardiovascular disease, patients with one, two, or three conditions (heart disease, stroke, and moderate CKD) had relative risk of mortality increased by about 70\%, 160\%, and 290\%, respectively; direct medical costs increased by about 70\%, 160\%, and 280\%, respectively; and life expectancy at age 60 years decreased by about 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Burdens were higher with severe CKD.                                         Conclusions               This study demonstrated extremely high mortality risk and medical cost increases for severe CKD, exceeding the combined effects from heart disease and stroke. Mortality risks and costs for moderate CKD, heart disease, and stroke were similar individually and roughly multiplicative for any combination. These findings suggest that to reduce mortality and health care costs in patients with hypertension, CKD prevention and intervention merits priority equal to that of cardiovascular disease.},

  abstract = {We examined the association of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke with birth weight and gestational age in a large, prospective study. We also compared these endpoints between infants of active maternal smokers and those of non-smoking, non-ETS exposed women. Pregnant women were interviewed by telephone during the first trimester, and pregnancy outcome was determined for 99\%. Among the 4,454 singleton live births that could be linked to their birth certificate, we confirmed increased risks of low birth weight and small for gestational age with heavier maternal smoking ({$>$} 10 cigarettes/day), as well as noting an increased risk for "very preterm" birth ({$<$} 35 weeks). These associations were generally stronger among infants of older ({$>$} or = 30 years) than those of younger mothers, as well as among non-whites. High environmental tobacco smoke exposure ({$>$} or = 7 hours/day in non-smokers) was moderately associated with low birth weight (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.8, 95\% confidence limits (95\% CL) = 0.82, 4.1), preterm birth (AOR 1.6, 95\% CL = 0.87, 2.9), and most strongly with very preterm birth (AOR 2.4, 95\% CL = 1.0, 5.3). These associations were generally greater among non-whites than whites. The data support earlier studies suggesting that prenatal environmental tobacco smoke exposure, in addition to maternal smoking, affects infant health.},

After reaching its highest level in four decades, the LBW rate among all births declined from 2006 to 2014 (3,4), but the trend reversed in 2015 and 2016 when the LBW rate increased (4), moving further away from the Healthy People 2020 goal of reducing LBW rates to 7.8\% of live births (5). This report shows trends in LBW, moderately low birthweight (MLBW), and very low birthweight (VLBW) by race and Hispanic origin from 2006 to 2016 for singleton births only, as rates of multiple births can impact LBW rates (4,6).},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Development of a fall prevention programme for psychogeriatric inpatients is required. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate factors associated with falls in psychogeriatric inpatients and compare two fall risk assessment tools. METHODS: This study had two parts. First, all fall reports involving psychogeriatric inpatients in United Christian Hospital in 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Factors associated with the falls were identified by comparing patients who had a fall incident and those who did not. Second, in a pilot study, 30 consecutive psychogeriatric inpatients were assessed for fall risk using the Morse Fall Scale (MFS) and the Wilson Sims Fall Risk Assessment Tool (WSFRAT), and outcomes were then compared with the modified Functional Ambulation Classification (MFAC). RESULTS: In 2016, 46 women and 47 men aged 65 to 94 years were admitted to the psychiatric wards (two women and two men were admitted twice). A total of 12 falls involving nine women and two men were reported. Over 66\% of falls involved patients with dementia, 75\% involved women, and over 50\% occurred on the way to the bathroom, mostly during the night shift when the staffing level was low. In the pilot study, of 30 consecutive psychogeriatric inpatients, 20 were classified as high risk by the WSFRAT and 10 of them were also classified as high risk by the MFS. Those classified as high risk by WSFRAT matched perfectly with those classified as high risk by MFAC. However, 30\% of those classified as high risk by MFAC were not classified as high risk by MFS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with dementia and women had higher risk of fall. Extra proportion of at-risk patients are able to benefit from additional fall risk interventions when WSFRAT is used instead of MFS. Further studies are needed to calculate the psychometric properties of WSFRAT.},

Although traditional risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and advanced age, are prevalent in ESRD patients they may not be sufficient by themselves to account for the high prevalence of CVD in patients with this condition. Thus, the search for other, non-traditional, risk factors that may be involved in the pathogenesis of uremic CVD has been an area of intense study. Data suggest that the accelerated atherosclerotic process of ESRD may involve several interrelated processes, such as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and vascular calcification, in a milieu of constant low-grade inflammation. The cause(s) of inflammation in ESRD are multifactorial and, while it may reflect underlying CVD, an acute-phase reaction may also be a direct cause of vascular injury via several pathogenetic mechanisms. Available data suggest that pro-inflammatory cytokines play a central role in the genesis of both malnutrition and CVD in ESRD. Thus, it could be speculated that suppression of the vicious cycle of malnutrition, inflammation and atherosclerosis (MIA syndrome) would improve survival in dialysis patients. Recent evidence has demonstrated strong associations between inflammation and both increased oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in ESRD patients. As there is not yet any recognized, or even proposed, treatment for ESRD patients with chronic inflammation it would be of obvious interest to study the long-term effect of various anti-inflammatory treatment strategies on the nutritional and cardiovascular status as well as outcome of these patients.},
