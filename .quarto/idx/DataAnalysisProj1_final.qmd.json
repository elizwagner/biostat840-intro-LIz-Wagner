And how might that affect album sales, if at all? \n\nThere have been studies done about how music is getting more negative [@lawrencetechnologicaluniversityPopularMusicLyrics2019]. Is it possible that this could also be affecting album sales? We will look at T Swift and Queen Bee to see if there is some evidence that their music is more negative over time.

Positivity rebounded a bit after being at its lowest with the album 1989. Sales seemed to not be affected by change in sentiment and is likely correlated with some other variable. However, most albums have more negative average sentiment than positive, as most albums fall below the 0 line, where positivity and negativity are equal.\n\nThis may be a trend overall, across the music industry. According to a study of sentiment of popular songs written from 1951 to 2016, there has been an increase in negative sentiment over time in lyrics [@napierQuantitativeSentimentAnalysis2018]. Further diving into what this has to do with album sales could be interesting.\n\n# List of Functions\n\nglimpse(), lubridate(), stringr(), forcats(), ggplot(), textdata(), separate_rows(), inner_join(), slice(), anti_join(), wordcloud(), mutate()\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"DataAnalysisProj1_final.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.36","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title":"Data Analysis Project","bibliography":["Proj1.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
