# Question

We will explore album sales and lyrics from two artists (Beyoncé and Taylor Swift), The data are available from TidyTuesday from September 2020. we want to know, is music getting sadder and angrier, and overall more negative in these artists' music? And how might that affect album sales, if at all? 

There have been studies done about how music is getting more negative [@lawrencetechnologicaluniversityPopularMusicLyrics2019]. Is it possible that this could also be affecting album sales? We will look at T Swift and Queen Bee to see if there is some evidence that their music is more negative over time. We will also consider if it affects album sales. 

# Intended Audience

This was a homework for 140.776 Statistical Computing in fall 2022. This could be useful for the general public that is interested in studying album sales of artists and their possible relation to the lyrics in the songs on the albums.

# Data

The datasets for this part of the assignment comes from [TidyTuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com).

# Data Wrangling

```{r}

# Use `lubridate` to create a column called `released` that is a `Date` class. However, to be able to do this, you first need to use `stringr` to search for pattern that matches things like this "(US)\[51\]" in a string like this "September 1, 2006 (US)\[51\]" and removes them. (**Note**: to get full credit, you must create the regular expression).

# Use `forcats` to create a factor called `country` (**Note**: you may need to collapse some factor levels).

sales <- readRDS(here("data","sales.RDS"))
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
sales$released <- str_remove_all(string=sales$released, pattern = "(US)|(UK)|[\\[\\]\\(\\)]|(39)|(51)")

sales <- sales %>% 
  mutate(released=mdy(released)) %>% 
  mutate(country = as.factor(country)) %>%
  mutate(country = fct_collapse(country,
  World = c("WW", "World"),
  FR = c("FR", "FRA")
))
```

```{r}
#Transform the `sales` into a unit that is album sales in millions of dollars.
sales$sales <-  as.numeric(sales$sales)/1000000
```

```{r}
#Keep only album sales from the UK, the US or the World.
#Auto print your final wrangled tibble data frame.
salesdf <- sales %>% 
   filter(country == "UK"|country == "US"| country == "World")
salesdf
```

In this section, we will do some more data wrangling followed by summarization using wrangled data from Part 1A.

```{r}
# Keep only album sales from the US.
sales1 <- sales %>% 
   filter(country == "US")
```

```{r}
#Create a new column called `years_since_release` corresponding to the number of years since the release of each album from Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. This should be a whole number and you should round down to "14" if you get a non-whole number like "14.12" years. (**Hint**: you may find the `interval()` function from `lubridate` helpful here, but this is not the only way to do this.)
sales1 <- sales %>% 
    mutate(years_since_release=(year(Sys.Date())-year(released)))
```

```{r}
#Calculate the most recent, oldest, and the median years since albums were released for both Beyoncé and Taylor Swift.
sales1 %>% 
  filter(artist=="Taylor Swift")%>%
  summarize(median = median(years_since_release),
            recent = min(years_since_release), 
            oldest = max(years_since_release))

sales1 %>% 
  filter(artist=="Beyoncé")%>%
  summarize(median = median(years_since_release),
            recent = min(years_since_release), 
            oldest = max(years_since_release))

```

```{r}
#Calculate the total album sales for each artist and for each `country` (only sales from the UK, US, and World).
sales2 <- sales %>% 
  filter(country == "UK"|country == "US"| country == "World")%>%
  group_by(artist, country) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(sales))
sales2
```

# Plots

```

# Summary

The sentiment of Taylor's albums have gotten more negative over time, as we can see the very first album has the highest positive average score. Positivity rebounded a bit after being at its lowest with the album 1989. Sales seemed to not be affected by change in sentiment and is likely correlated with some other variable. However, most albums have more negative average sentiment than positive, as most albums fall below the 0 line, where positivity and negativity are equal.

This may be a trend overall, across the music industry. According to a study of sentiment of popular songs written from 1951 to 2016, there has been an increase in negative sentiment over time in lyrics [@napierQuantitativeSentimentAnalysis2018]. Further diving into what this has to do with album sales could be interesting.
